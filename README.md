# ++shopping

This is a functional example app of a basic shopping cart using the Gatsby ecosystem - react-redux is used for state tracking, Tailwind CSS for styling, etc.

## Running the app
Make sure you have both Gatsby (gatsby-cli) and NodeJS (v16.8+) installed. Then just run `npm install` and `npm start` as usual.
